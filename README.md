### Background
We have an spreadsheet used to log worktimes and calculate pay based on hourly rates. The aim of the project is to read information from the spreadsheet and implement the data into a game that can encourage regular and percise data entry.

Design:
  > The player earns credits based upon his/her data input into the spreadsheet, encouraging consistent and specific entries. 
  > Using these credits, players could build out their city and compete on a leaderboard for asthetic points.

### _Current Tools_:
* Unity
* Visual Studio 2019
   * Monodevelop *(if no VS)*
